<h1>Web Of Chaos</h1>


<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
The "Web Of Chaos" project aims to create an easy-to-use online system for predicting time series data using Chaos Theory. This cost-effective alternative to Matlab offers users an intuitive platform with advanced analytical tools, promotes chaos research in Malaysia, and provides features like usage reports and seamless data processing, making cutting-edge analysis accessible to all.
